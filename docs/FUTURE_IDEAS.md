# Future Ideas

Features to potentially add later. Use this to store concepts removed from the app for now.

## Scheduling Copilot
**Status:** Removed from UI  
**Original Location:** `components/scheduling/CopilotPanel.tsx`

### Description
AI-assisted roster generation for dog care facilities.

### How it would work:
1. Manager enters expected dog counts per area (Daycare, Boarding, Suites)
2. Sets date range for the schedule
3. Clicks "Generate Roster"
4. System auto-creates shifts based on:
   - Staffing ratios (e.g., 1 staff per 15 dogs)
   - Staff availability
   - Existing schedule patterns

### Why removed:
- Not functional yet (UI only)
- Want to build core features first
- Can revisit when app is more mature
